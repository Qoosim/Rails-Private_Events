# 🔐 Private-Events - Rolling My Own Associations

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).

In this project, I build a simple, exclusive site similar to a private <b><i>Eventbrite</i></b> which allows users to create events and then manage the users signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many usesrs.

## 🎯 The Project Brief

The specifications and the guides to the project can be found on The Odin Project's [Project: Private Events](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations) page.

This project focuses heavily on testing our understanding of associations on web apps. Specifically, in this project we are given the task to build a site where users can create events, invite other users to an events and where an event can be attended by many users. The ability to create associations among those objects is the main focus of the project.

The associations systems implemented into this project include:
  - User authentication - Password encryption and password digest storage to avoid storing raw user passwords
  - Session for user authentication
